   server [here](http://www.rtk2go.com/new-reservation/), follow the instructions on the website and leave all settings
   to the default where possible

## Raspberry Pi Setup

1. download the latest **Raspberry Pi OS** Lite image [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/)
2. download the latest **balenaEtcher** software [here](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
3. flash the **Raspberry Pi OS** Lite image to the **Raspberry Pi** microSD Card using **balenaEtcher**
4. create a file named ssh without any content in the root of the boot partition
5. create a file named wpa_supplicant.conf in the same directory with the required information filled in, a template is
   provided [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/run-raspberry-pi-in-a-true-headless-state-cfb3431667de)
6. the previous link also provides a description how to connect to the **Raspberry Pi** via SSH, follow it and connect
   to the device
7. execute the commands ```sudo apt update``` and ```sudo apt full-upgrade``` to install the latest packages on your
   **Raspberry Pi**
8. execute the command ```sudo apt install rtklib``` to execute the required library on your **Raspberry Pi**
9. fill in the password (PASSWD) and the mountpoint (MNTPNT) of the RTK2go NTRIP server in
   this [service file](base.service)
10. use ```scp``` to copy the filled service file to the **Raspberry Pi** home directory as
    described [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/)
11. copy the service file from the home directory to the folder ```/etc/systemd/system/``` using the ```cp``` command
12. execute the command ```sudo systemctl enable base.service``` to start this service at the next boot up
13. reboot the **Raspberry Pi** using the command ```sudo reboot```, you will have to reconnect to SSH again after the
    device has rebooted
14. after reconnecting check that the command ```sudo systemctl status base.service``` returns the status active
